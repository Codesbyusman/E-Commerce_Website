This is only a website tempelate. It is non-functional, non-responsive website tempelate that is user friendly with less use of CSS. The *"Hamari Dukan"* used is an arbitaray logo of companay that is taken from the internet and can be replaced by your company's logo. By non-functional means it doesn't provide the functionality of buttons and doesn't stores data, simply no use of java script. Although linking is done.
